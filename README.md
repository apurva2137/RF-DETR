## RF-DETR: Reference-Free DETR

## Overview

RF-DETR (Reference-Free DETR) is an advanced object detection model that improves upon the original DETR (DEtection TRansformer) by eliminating the need for handcrafted object queries. It enhances detection performance with faster convergence and higher efficiency.

## Features

- Reference-Free Queries: Removes dependency on predefined queries, making the model more flexible.

- Faster Convergence: Addresses DETR's slow training issue with improved attention mechanisms.

- Enhanced Transformer Architecture: Optimized layers for better object representation and accuracy.

- Improved Matching Strategy: Refines bipartite matching for more stable predictions.
